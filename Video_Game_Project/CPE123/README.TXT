This is the Milestone 3 for group 3 "fun":
Our game starts in the desert of Ackmadel. Our character Dalia spawns and is told controls via the signs on the map. Her mom tells her to stay, but she keeps going. The player is then taken through a quick tutorial about how to play the game. This includes the basics such as jumping, moving, and attacking. To test out the newly learned skills, the player goes through a small obstacle course, helping them learn by doing. Throughout the level, the player controls dalia as she avoids and attack enemies, and jumps from platform to platform. At the end of the level, the giant scorpian boss comes out. The player has to time their hits perfectly in order to defeat the boss. Once the boss is defeated a character comes out and tells dalia and the player a little bit of info about her father and what first happened to him. Then the player will get taken to the item shop, where they can see possible items they could invest in. We have level 1 complete and level 4 almost done.

There is still much refinement and tuning we need to do to get the perfect level of challenge and excitement in addition to addressing little bugs
